cover israel totally back easiest attacking another use innocent shield and hope that respects innocent lives tim guerillas wrong assuming that civilians for cover assuming come brad anywhere this discussion doesn bring elements never addressed commented made comment wrong that civilians used cover and that israelis and guerillas will injured parties continue fight purpose army use military uniforms set members apart civilians that civilians will not thought side combatants you meaning intention and effect army purposely not uniforms civilians judging that benefit will receive this cover important that harm that will come civilians this comment israeli experience and that guerillas responsibility putting civilians middle this fight putting uniforms and living apart civilians barracks etc guerillas significantly lower risk civilians guerillas this aren putting greater risk absolutely set ourselves apart wearing uniforms ready made cover for civilians that makes sense point view this cover used guerillas accept responsibility for subsequent harm civilians buffer zone prevent attacks israel not working neccessary for israeli guns pound lebanese villages not kill infiltrate buffer zone you shelling villages called retaliation getting back getting even doesn make sense shell villages shows reckless disregard israeli government for lives civilians agree you thought that israel bombing sortees and bombing policy stupid thoughtless inhumane and ineffective reason that israel passive wait attackers chose act reason that taking fight enemy will stop attacks previously israel spent decades sitting passively side border and acting stop attacks attackers had entered israeli territory didn work host arab state nothing and stop attacks side border israel number attacks considerably higher physical and psychological impact civilians caught path bit attacks israel neighboring arab states can start hope for this happen will occur arab states show that prepared responsibility and duty stop guerilla attacks israel soil prove provide guaratees israel accept word not past attitude tolerance anti israel guerillas residence israel not willing accept word imho business wasting time coming peace talks this another selectively applied statement reason for this drawn impasse ababs palestinians and israelis that side willing accept word your criteria stay negotiations that precisely palestinians recent pisga proposal for interim period negotiations and leading full autonomy demanding conditions that essentially define autonomy not trust that israel will follow entire process and palestinians reach full autonomy you understand and accept this viewpoint palestinians you israel view arabs palestinians trust arab palestinians words since don reluctant give tangible assets land control areas exchange for words for this reason concerned sorts guarantees will that arabs will follow part agreement reached don you that statement can made ways lebanon interested peace accept word israel that attacks for war and disarming hizbollah will remove for continued occupancy absolutely arabs palestinians asking for israelis word relation agreement demanded land issue land and party finally gets hold this land party totally irrelevent possession this land your words absolutely power whether israel chooses word not land back afterall israel staged two parts withdrawal areas occupied lebanon slg tim you ignoring fact that palestinians lebanon disarmed hezbollah remains independent militia hezbollah not attack israel times such idf burned sheikh mosavi wife and young son major armaments allowing people wage civil wars removed weapons needed cross border attacks remain extent rocket attacks continue and commando raids require easily concealed weapons and refined disregard for human life that such attacks continue israel withdraw lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages wouldn make lebanese mad that bat guano situation you call for existed and attacks commonplace hezbollah subsequently disarmed not groups can effectively disarmed state authoritarian syria for lebanon constantly patrol entire border israel essentially mirroring israel border secirity side prove isreal that this committed protecting israel attack lebanese territory once syria leaves that lebanon will retain control syria stays thay even dangerous for israel tim last time that you recall trouble syrian border not that doesn that mean that syria lebanon don israel lebanon that sides receive tangible arabs palestinians for land and

israelis dear shai answer question nonexistence israeli nationality your answer conflicts information received quarters two distinct categories classifying israelis citizenship ezrahut and nationality used passports etc and for daily identification israeli society told that people israel carry cards times and present public places almost day cards make clear holder jew arab you maintain that this religious services provided you that this reason you provide evidence that this case and that serves purpose number points you making assumptions manner cards used true law residents citizens and tourists carry form identification for citizens standard card purpose this serves daily basis presented public places for purpose identifying bearer this takes place banks cashing checks post offices registered mail and such etc quite frankly rare that had present card for such activities once per week law requirement that forces people wave cards public services outlined discriminate bearer manner access this information case that can field into account interaction police based scenario general arab citizens recognizable arabs your argument becomes moot you can provide example this field used discriminate officially answer second questions fact that israel fixed borders you state that israel borders shaped and reshaped war and peace read zionists beginning century had plans for jewish state extend into lebanon and into transjordan jordan read that express ben gurion not declare israel borders israel established this restrict israel opportunities for expansion israel claims existence fact that jews lived years ago that god promised land biblical sources area god promised extend iraq and borders biblical times israel considers proper use today finally israel peace can declare considers legitimate and secure borders base for negotiations facts mind cannot blame arab countries fear israeli expansionism number wars proved issue your assertions that arab countries that nothing fear israeli expansionism militarily israel not capable holding large tracts land occupation hostile armed and insurgent population for sustained period time intifada heavily taxing israeli economy proof this can israeli withdrawal lebanon israeli troops pulled back awali and litani order control minimal strip needed towns range katyusha missile fire public opinion israel turned settling intifada territorial concessions israel public sufferring battle fatigue sorts and gov aware regards borders state not agree manner negotiations held crux matter that makes refrains stating starting position arab parties called for total withdrawal and return pre borders israel state large borders negotiations never israel state smaller borders arab countries and force even smaller borders negotiations that leaving matter settled negotiations and peace treaties infinitely realistic and sensible your answer question typical stalinist public official don your answer honest you refer vanunu revelations israel nuclear arsenal evaluating truthfullness revelations truth punished and lied punished honesty your statement typical simple minded naivety center for policy research whether not vanunu revelations true bearing fact that for disclosing state secrets signed contracts and forms understanding that secrets not made public punished and weren moral obligation disclose that quite reverse fact court and found guilty you issue number things you understanding concept secrets state democratic govt provided answer fourth question hidden prisoners israeli prisons posted article ariv documenting such cases that such prisoners exist israel you that noticed that documenting fact that such prisoners exist documented fact that exist clu noted you evidently not pay attention that such reports cases you country mill tightly knit israel even matter arrest not made public relatively short time frame people feelings that matter arrest made public court order issued allowing delay hours this granted judge convinced that announcement irreparable harm ongoing investigation you imply that questions show bias and formulated such cast aspersions israel such terms used soviet union dissidents call soviet union into disrepute questions not disturbing not call such hysterical answers questions provocative meant seek facts happy you convince that told israel fabrications alas you failed suspect that you fear truth and open and honest discussion this sign weakness not strength that your questions slanted such questions termed tabloid journalism and not disturbing avoid attempt objectivity such questions used mccarthy era basis for witch hunts that place use your example questions lifted format used stalinist prosecutors that for small bits evidence that distort and portray larger and dirtier picture answers not hysterical questions problem not that provocative that selective fact seeking you fall into category seek answers real answer sorts suspect that long answers
