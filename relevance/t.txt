related to  interfacial energy :
 Several techniques have been reported in the litera-ture for the measurements of the solid–liquid interfa-cial energy  0.318772665866
 In addition , the maximumundercooling is often not achieved due to the pres-ence of catalytic sites in the system [ 6 ]  0.316676776887
 Another com-mon technique is the grain boundary groove method , which utilizes the equilibrium conditions at the triple-line between two solid grains and a liquid [ 7 , 8 ]  0.322546440091
Although this technique has given significant resultsfor average values of the interfacial energy , it has notyet been used for the measurement of anisotropy  0.401937924526
 The orientation-dependent interfacial energy canalso be measured directly by characterizing the equi-librium shape of solid particles in a liquid or liquiddroplets in a solid  0.379659890569
 In the work described here , theanisotropy of crystal-melt interfacial energy for anAl–4 0.506563975344
 where m indicates the degree of rotational crystalsymmetry about the section plane normal  0.31340813571
18 which is closeto the value of the equilibrium solute partition coef-ficient at 595°C for the Al–Cu system  0.343844076581
 The shape of the as-quenched droplet may deviate from the true equilib-rium shape because interface motion of severalmicrometers may occur during the quench [ 20 , 21 ]  0.348867882448
The transition at the interface is characterized by lineDE by fitting the related data  0.354832251322
 The interface location , C , is then indicated by the intersection between thelines AB and DE  0.339831009881
 The effect of quenching was eliminatedfrom droplet shape measurements by using compo-sition profiles near the droplet interface to determinethe pre-quench interface location  0.383598242726
 Using these pro-cedures for 2-D equilibrium shape measurements onselected { 0 0 1 } sections , the magnitude of anisotropyfor the solid–liquid interfacial energy was determinedto be 0 0.355437866057

 However they did not quantitatively evaluatethe magnitude of the anisotropy parameter  0.307263270215
related to  equilibrium:
0 wt % Cu alloy is determinedthrough measurement of equilibrium shape  0.363463561763
 Another com-mon technique is the grain boundary groove method , which utilizes the equilibrium conditions at the triple-line between two solid grains and a liquid [ 7 , 8 ]  0.32590024557
 Consequently , equilibrium shapes are moreeffectively measured using a fine dispersion of liquiddroplets that are entrained in the solid  0.310571743168
 With the objective of preparing an equilibrium lowvolume-fraction dispersion of liquid droplets in a sin- To verify that equilibrium conditions were achi-eved in the droplets examined , a composition profilewas measured using SEM/EDS along a line across thedroplet and into the solid  0.323162953294
